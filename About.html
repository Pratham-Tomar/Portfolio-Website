                    <p class="ttool"> Greetings! Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Pratham Tomar, and it is a pleasure to be part of this esteemed community. I received my early education at K.B.D Public School, where I cultivated a strong academic foundation. At present, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science Engineering from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, located in Modinagar, Ghaziabad. With a deep passion for technology, I have honed my skills in front-end development, specializing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am well-versed in using frameworks such as Tailwind CSS and React.js to create captivating user interfaces. Additionally, my proficiency extends to back-end development, specifically utilizing Node.js.                    
                        Moreover, I am an avid Data Analyst enthusiast. The art of analyzing and interpreting data fascinates me, and I strive to enhance my expertise in this field. Furthermore, I actively practice data structures and algorithms, as they are instrumental in problem-solving and decision-making.
                        Throughout my journey, I have gained valuable experiences in the field of web development and data analysis. I had the privilege of undergoing training and an internship at AcmeGrade, where I deepened my knowledge and skills in web development. This opportunity allowed me to work on real-world projects and expand my expertise in building dynamic and engaging websites.In addition, I had the honor of being a part of the Alteryx community as an intern in their Data Analyst program. This experience provided me with valuable insights into the world of data analysis and allowed me to work with industry professionals. It was a tremendous learning experience where I gained hands-on exposure to data manipulation, visualization, and advanced analytics techniques.Furthermore, I had the opportunity to intern as a web developer at CodeClause Company. This internship allowed me to apply my skills in a professional setting, contributing to the development of web applications and enhancing my understanding of back-end systems and database management.
